# Nooro-Grounding-Mat-Experience

When [the Nooro Grounding Mat Official Website](https://www.offerplox.com/e-commerce/nooro-grounding-mat/) arrived, I was excited yet unsure of what to expect. It’s a sleek, simple mat that fits neatly on my desk or under my feet while sitting. The mat itself is soft to the touch and feels comfortable against the skin. It comes with a grounding cord that you plug into a grounded outlet. There was no complicated setup—just plug it in, and you’re good to go.

I decided to try it out during my afternoon work session. I placed the mat on the floor and rested my feet on it while I typed away at my computer. At first, I didn’t notice any immediate changes, but I made a conscious effort to keep my feet on the mat for at least an hour.
